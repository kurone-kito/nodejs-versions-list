# ðŸŸ¨ `@kurone-kito/nodejs-versions-list`: JSON of Node.js versions list

Getting a list of Node.js versions can sometimes be a pain. Typically,
you can parse the [official dist](https://nodejs.org/dist) to get it,
but you may want to get the version number more easily.

There is also a handy library for this purpose,
**[`all-node-versions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-node-versions)**.

The `@kurone-kito/nodejs-versions-list` library pre-parses the
results of _his_ library into JSON so that you can get a list of
versions of this package at the time you installed it.

## System requirements

- Node.js >= 14.17

## Usage

First, you should install this package in your project.

```sh
npm install @kurone-kito/nodejs-versions-list
```

```sh
yarn add @kurone-kito/nodejs-versions-list
```

And, thatâ€™s all!

```ts
import list from '@kurone-kito/nodejs-versions-list';

console.log(JSON.stringify(list.versions));
console.log(JSON.stringify(list.majors));
```

Since the body is _JSON_, you need to specify the `resolveJsonModule`
flag if you want to use it in your TypeScript project.

See the
**[all-node-versions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/all-node-versions)**
packageâ€™s document for the JSON structure.

    /** Major version number. `0` for old releases `0.*.*`. */
    major: number;
  }[];
  /**
